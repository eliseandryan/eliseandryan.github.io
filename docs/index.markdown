## Booking Accomodations

For ease of access, we recommend staying a little bit outside of the city, near a major train line.
We are located in Artarmon, which is a suburb in Sydney, and we live along the T1 Train line. The T1 train line makes it easy to get into and out of the city, as well as is a good line that has access to the greater Sydney area because its attached to the new METRO (M1).
Finding a house to rent will be difficult in the city, but most locations north or west of the city are lovely, just keep in mind distance to the activities you may want to do.

For best access to the city and its activities, an hour by train is an easy and affordable trip! If you book farther out, it may be cheaper, but will be a bit more of a hassle to get to some places in the main parts of the city.

If you find something else outside of these areas and want advice on if its an easy place to get around, just send us a message or email and we’ll be able to answer your questions!

See more details about the train lines [here](/train-guide.html).

## In-Australia Travel

Its not usually necessary to rent a car. It is very easy to get around using public transit. But if you are going to be renting a car, please keep in mind that Aussie road laws are A LOT stricter than US laws, and most of the city is covered in red light cameras and automatic speed cameras.

Car rental’s are affordable, and usually wont try and scam you too hard. We also have several “Car share” apps, like ‘No Birds’, and ‘Go Get.’

For any and all public transit, Sydney has a fairly simple system. You can either buy an “Opal” card to tap on and off of Trains, Busses, Trams, and Ferry's, Or you can use any credit or debit card with Tap capabilities.

There is also a train line direct from the international airport, so depending on baggage don’t feel required to get a taxi. We also have Lyft and Uber, with the same app used in the US, so no need to download a new app.

If you will be travelling with children and need car seats or mobility aids, please reach out to us and we can help prepare things for when you arrive to make things a bit easier!

## Internet and Phone

We recommend using an E-sim while you’re here if you don't already have plans or roaming with your US plan! It is a lot cheaper than paying Travel prices on a US plan.
Here are two websites with some affordable plans to choose from!

## Travel Insurance

Not always necessary for international travel, but if you plan on doing any intense hikes, surfing, or other more intense activities, it can be really helpful to have in case of emergencies. We wont be able to see travel plans from the US to AUS, so you’ll have to do your own research on it!

## Money

Cash is always good to have on hand for emergencies, but it’s not necessary to be prepared for travel around Australia. Almost everywhere takes card, so as long as you know what the exchange rate is and have an account that wont charge you roaming fees, you’ll be fine!
